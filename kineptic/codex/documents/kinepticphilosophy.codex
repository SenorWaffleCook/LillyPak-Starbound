    "What is the nature of reality? What are we really? Are we what we think we are, or are we something else? Obviously, we are the Kineptic: one look in a mirror makes that clear--but there's something about the nature of the universe we live in that makes it feel like there's more to it. Something we can't see. Something that interacts with us in ways we cannot comprehend unless it is revealed to us.",

    "It's a rather heated topic to discuss with other intelligent species. The Boundary is nothing but a delusion to them; our search little more than a game. What they don't realize is that if we could get to the other side of this boundary and look back, the secrets of the universe would be in plain sight."
