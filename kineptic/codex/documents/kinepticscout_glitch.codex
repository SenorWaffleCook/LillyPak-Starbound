	"Day 1
So these clunky things are the reason Nepet was sealed away? They hardly look threatening. I mean, look at them! These rustbuckets are using CROSSBOWS. Anyway, I've been snooping around town with my cloaking spell. Apparently they operate under a hive mind, with the exception of ones they call 'The Outcasts'. Finding one of these would be a lot safer than asking one of the hive-minded.",
	
	"Day 2
By a stroke of good luck, I ran into a Ms. Hiraki Corale on what she called one of her 'grand adventures'. As it turns out, she was able to point me in the direction of the outcasts' base of operations. I decided to take the time to ask her about her species, but instead of answering my questions she became very excited and insisted on dragging me along with her to visit her homeworld. I politely dismissed myself at that time, since she was starting to garner unwanted attention.",

	"Day 3
The outcast are far more advanced than their hiveminded counterparts. On my arrival, I was received with a slew of emotions ranging from shock to excitement, and everything in between. They showed great interest in my gloves, and we had a quaint little discussion about their significance to kineptican culture. As the day drew to a close, my hosts graciously offered me one of the least olfactorily-offending rooms to stay in. All in all, I felt very encouraged with how things were going.",

	"Day 4
Today I met with the leader of the outcast, Platinum Ace. She was very passionate about freeing her hiveminded kin from their bondage. Given how readily accepted I was by the outcast, I can easily say it is in the kineptics' best interest that her plans see fruition. When asked about how the hiveminds would react to my presence, she informed me that they would likely be wary due to past events, but 'magic' was more or less accepted under most of hive society.",

	"-Day 4 continued-
Platinum must have seen the resentment in my bindi, as she proceeded to comfort and assure me that what happened all those years ago is well and truly in the past.",

	"Conclusion
Platinum informed me that I am welcome back any time, though she understands if I don't since my nose can't be turned off like hers. I think it goes without saying that as far as the glitch are concerned, they are a minimal threat as long as the outcast are around. I thank my Guardian for keeping me safe in this endeavour, and ask for continued protection and guidance in my continued mission to observe the rest of the intelligent races of the universe!"
