    "Long ago, the Kineptic found themselves on the business end of propaganda, mudslinging, and hysteria. A tragic mistake on their part became a full-fledged genocide on the entire race, driving them to the brink of extinction. In the thick of that extistential threat, the few hundred survivors sealed away their entire planet, cloaking it from the surrounding universe.",

	"Of course, hiding an entire planet is no mean feat. The amount of energy required to maintain such a thing was enormous. The survivors realized this and, knowing there was no room for internal disagreements, banded together as a single, united people.",

	"For over 1,000 years they kept the cloak up, but it was all too clear that the planet was unable to support the endeavor indefinitely. With little other choice, the Kineptic ventured back out into the universe to seek help with restoring their dying planet and the hope that history had forgotten the past."
