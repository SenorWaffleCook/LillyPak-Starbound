    "Log Entry 198:

Progress on the machine is going strong. We are finally ready for the first full-combat scenario: running with all weapons systems, maximal threat detection levels, the works.",

    "Log Entry 202:

Fine-tuning the combat protocols is an ongoing endeavour, the machine simply isn't vicious enough. Aside from a few mishaps with the bio-regen suppression field, there have been few safety problems. Perhaps we need to relax the failsafes.",

	"Log Entry 209:

As the final stage in the testing procedure, it's time to take out all the stops. For this full-capacity AI run, we've abducted an expendable human to stand-in for a real pilot. We said that it was chosen because it was good at video games. As if it even could be without flippers!

It's time to see what the Mecharachnid's true capabilities are.",
